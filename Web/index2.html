                <h2>1.Sound Wave Table Terrain Synthesis</h2>
                <p>Wave table terrain synthesis can be defined as an audio waveform created through tracking the height of a large ball rolling in an orbit around a hilly landscape. Altering the orbit of the ball across the terrain the output waveform can be transformed radically. The orbit is usually generated through an elliptical function, in soundWaveT the sonification is generated through gestures on the screen of an Ipad.</p>
                <h2>2.Views</h2>
                <p>The first view displayed when you access SondWaveT it is the home view, on this view you can read the manual of SoundWaveT and you can listen at the same time a composition realised in Csound, you can also visualise a video tutorial for SoundWaveT.</p>

                <p>The second view of the application its the actual instrument based on sound wave terrain synthesis, the audio engine have been developed in Csound. The Csound code utilize is a modification of Jon Christopher Nelson from the Csound book. The colour values which the user interact with red, green and blue (RGB) in Csound control the amplitude of the oscillators and Alpha the envelope value for the addition of the R, G, and B oscillators outputs. The frequency oscillation of each oscillator is defined by the velocity of the gesture realized. The sonic texture obtained, when a finger is glided across the screen, is similar to stochastic particles as each of the pixel colours can have sonic property. The property of each pixel being dependent on the definition of the pixel, the velocity of the movement, the direction, and the coordinates. The other mode of interaction is with short chunk, also dependent on the colours  crossed over and the velocity obtained. A different sonic texture is obtained using Wavetable terrain synthesis. The ftable implemented for this first approach is a moving orbit, but even with one static ftable the sound outputted it is relatively unpredictable. SondWaveT is orientated to perform or generate sound to realise a composition for a electroacoustic piece.
